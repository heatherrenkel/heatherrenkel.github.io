    <title>What is Excess Death</title>
    <link>https://heatherrenkel.github.io/blog/what_is_excess_death.html/xml/xml_rss.asp</link>
    <description>CDATA[Since the start the Covid-19 pandemic, the scope of itâ€™s severity often has been expressed in terms of Covid cases. The Covid death toll is then also based on this; its Covid cases who died that are listed as Covid deaths. But relying on who is recorded as a Covid case is not the best way to determine the impact of Covid, there is another way of measuring deaths that can be done by finding excess deaths. What is excess death, why it is important, and several prominent methods of measuring excess death in during the Covid pandemic are examined.]]</description>

    <title>The Noise from Brazil</title>
    <link>https://heatherrenkel.github.io/blog/noise_from_Brazil.html/xml/xml_rss.asp</link>
    <description>[CDATA[Ariel Karlinsky is an economist and statistician who has become well known during the Covid pandemic for his excess death estimates. Even if his name is not familiar, his data surely will be, since it is used as a reference by many official sources.  Unfortunately his death estimates that so many rely on are corrupt. In addition to the many other errors in his excess death methods the method he uses for Brazil raises current mortality there by 8% above the official listed counts, artificially making excess death permanent and a return to normal impossible.]]</description>

    <link>https://heatherrenkel.github.io/blog/report_9.html/xml/xml_rss.asp</link> ????
    <description>[CDATA[Years after the Covid pandemic started we are still both mired in mitigations and suffering from their effects. Report number nine was the work of Neil Ferguson and the Imperial College of London that started the panic and brought about lockdowns for most of the world. Just how corrupt the report was is unbelievable and it's lack of scientific integrity is worth examining in detail]]</description>

    <description>[CDATA[The Wall Street Journal proclaims in its ads that it's integrity and trustworthiness as a source will then be transferred to the reader, yet they consider their sources trustworthy only as long as they like the message. At the beginning of April 2020 Dr. Michael Levitt was asked by The Wall Street Journal to write an editorial piece about his his research on the Covid-19, but then immediately rejected it without explaination]]</description>

    <title>Science Based Censorship Censoring Science During Covid</title>
    <link>https://heatherrenkel.github.io/blog/censored_sciencebasedmedicine.html/xml/xml_rss.asp</link>
    <description>[CDATA[Censorship of scientists and citizens during the Covid pandemic. It's not only experts that have been censored during the Covid crisis, it is also anyone who attempts to promote or defend them. On November 25, 2021 I attempted to submit a comment on the website sciencebasedmedicine.org in response to the article posted there on November 19, 2021 by Jonathan Howard, Contrarian Doctors: The Pandemic is Over, Again which attacked many scientists who have opposed various aspects of the response to the Covid and produced scientific evidence that ran contrary to claims made by other scientists or the media. My comment was immeditely removed, and the appeal I made to reconsider my post was rejected]]</description>
