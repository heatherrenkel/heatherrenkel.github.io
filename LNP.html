<p>if positively charged lipids are toxic, are we sure they have resolved that issue and at some point in the body the charge doesn’t return to positive again?</p> 

<p>from: [ https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-delivery/Without-lipid-shells-mRNA-vaccines/99/i8 ]
“The most effective nanoparticles were ones that the body mistook as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol—commonly called bad cholesterol. Proteins that recognize LDL cholesterol in the blood bound to some of Alnylam’s nanoparticles and carried them to LDL receptors on liver cells,”
“Positively charged lipids are inherently toxic, “

“Tweaking the ratio of the four lipids in the nanoparticles altered the LNPs’ distribution in the body.”

“Pfizer and BioNTech licensed an ionizable lipid called ALC-0315 from Acuitas. Those ionizable lipids, which are remarkably similar in structure, were discovered while the firms were optimizing LNPs for systemic administration and delivery to the liver—not the intramuscular injection of a vaccine.”

“these authors were able to make larger 100 nm LNPs with a twofold increase in mRNA expression compared to the 64 nm-sized LNPs. Thus, in addition to the LNP pKa, ionizable lipid molecular shape and the dynamics of the PEG–lipid, more detailed features of the LNP ultrastructure and the state of each component are also important in determining potency.
** Endosomal Release Cell uptake and endosomal trafficking of siRNA-LNPs were studied in detail and are assumed to be similar to the uptake and endosomal trafficking of mRNA LNPs.** 
With the MC3 LNP, a quantitative study using colloidal gold particle counting in electron microscopy showed that only 2% of siRNA that were in endosomes actually escaped from endosomes into the cytosol, resulting in a few thousand siRNA molecules per cell that were available for silencing [106]. This number was, however, in the same range as the estimated levels of functionally active siRNAs interacting with RISC per cell at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Thus, the vast majority of siRNA was destined for lysosomal degradation or recycling through multivesicular bodies (late endosomes) for release in the exosomes [143,144]. Increasing the endosomolytic behavior of LNPs is the central approach to improving delivery efficiency, mainly through pKa adjustment of the LNP and by increasing the cone-shaped morphology of the ionizable lipid. For the latter, Lipid H [42] and Lipid 5 [101], which contain three branches versus two in MC3, but with similar pKa ,increased endosomal release fourfold compared to MC3. 

Endosomal release has not been reported for Acuitas ALC-0315; however, its hepatocyte silencing efficiency was 10-fold higher than MC3 [47], suggesting its more cone-shaped four-branch structure also had higher endosomal release. These newer generation ionizable lipids therefore appear to achieve a endosomal release, closer to 15% or higher compared to the 2–5% found for MC3 siRNA-LNP…One of the challenges in this area is the lack of a reliable standardized endosomal release method that can be implemented broadly. Many methods have been developed, but are usually specific to only one lab group [42,101,145–149]. mRNA was also recently shown to undergo exocytosis in an amount that is similar to the amount released into the cytosol [150]. MC3 LNPs disassembled in late endosomes and NP 1 complexes of MC3 and the mRNA were repackaged into exosomes that were exported from the cell.”

	<h3>blebs</h3>

Encapsulation State of messenger  RNA inside lipid nanoparticles Mark Brader
Brader et al., Encapsulation state of messenger RNA inside lipid nanoparticles, Biophysical Journal (2021), https://doi.org/ 10.1016/j.bpj.2021.03.012  https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(21)00241-1.pdf  
“mRNA-LNPs are known to form both spherical and highly nonspherical morphologies  but the origins and practical implications of these morphological variants remain unclear. Molecular simulation studies indicate that the LNP structure may involve solvent pockets, and experimental studies have shown nonspherical morphologies to be associated with segregation of the bilayer-forming 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) component, resulting in pronounced blebs .
“Furthermore, it is apparent from the dye-stained image of the nonspherical LNP specimen (Fig. 3 a) that mRNA resides inside the bleb compartment and that the distinctive mottled mass density apparent in the nondye image can now be assigned to mRNA. This interpretation differs from that of Leung and co-workers , who reported a strikingly similar cryo-EM image yet assigned the mRNA location to the body of the particle ad- joined to the solvent-filled bleb. 
To gain further evidence that this distinctive mottled cryo-EM motif may be assigned to mRNA, the LNP of Fig. 3 a was dialyzed overnight into pH 5 buffer, causing a major change to its overall morphology (Fig. 3 d). Now recognizing that the mottled mass density inside the bleb corresponds to mRNA, it is apparent that the pH 5 condition caused the mRNA to re-associate with the lipidic body of the LNP, leaving the bleb compartment empty. This observation aligns with the widely accepted understanding of a charge-driven basis for LNP assembly at low pH—evidently, adjustment to pH 5 has caused the amino lipid to become positively charged, thereby driving re-association with the negatively charged mRNA” ….
“Recognizing that mRNA can dissociate from the charged lipid to reside within a solvent-filled bleb compartment has direct implications for the chemical microenvironment of the mRNA and confers a new significance to this liposomal-like LNP structural domain.””

Lipid nanoparticles particles alone can  cause injury in this study. They affect blood clotting, prolonging thromboplastin or prothrobin time, and heart hemorrhaging and liver injury was observed. Negative outcomes are increased by multiple doses, and fibrinogen levels also elevated with multiple dosing. In addition it had a tendacy to increase cytocine activation.

<h3>Lipid tails</h3>

Ionization and structural properties of mRNA lipid nanoparticles influence expression in intramuscular and intravascular administration; Manuel J. Carrasco, Suman Alishetty, Mohamad-Gabriel Alameh, Hooda Said, Lacey Wright, Mikell Paige, Ousamah Soliman, Drew Weissman, Thomas E. Cleveland IV, Alexander Grishaev & Michael D. Buschmann ;Communications Biology volume 4, Article number: 956 (2021); Published: 11 August 2021 

”Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are now accepted modalities following the Emergency Use Approval of two highly efficacious vaccines that are based on lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of nucleoside-modified mRNA sequences encoding for a modified version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein1,2.  mRNA LNPs bear a structural resemblance to viral systems and circulating endogenous lipid-containing chylomicrons in terms of size and lipid envelope 3. These features contribute to the application of mRNA-LNPs as delivery vehicles for vaccines and other therapeutics including transcripts encoding antibodies for endogenous translation4 or enzymes for in vivo gene editing5. It is noteworthy that all 8 mRNA vaccines in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 use LNPs as the delivery system.”
“The central feature of the ionizable lipid that was necessary for high delivery efficiency was the pKa of the LNP needed to be between 6 and 7, as determined using the anionic fluorescent dye 2-(p-toluidino)-6-naphthalenesulfonic acid (TNS) binding assay. With a pKa near 6.5, the LNP at neutral pH is negatively charged (from the nucleic acid payload). However, once inside the cell in endosomes the pH declines to near 4.5 prior to lysosomal fusion thereby protonating the LNP, which facilitates ion pair formation of the cationic ionizable lipid with anionic endogenous endosomal phospholipids3.

At this point, the second feature that is known to control potency comes into play, namely the molecular shape of the ionizable lipid 11,12. A more cone-shaped (versus cylindrical) ionizable lipid is desirable since a small head group and broader molecular cross-section in the tail region are incompatible with a lipid bilayer thereby destabilizing the endosomal membrane and allowing the nucleic acid payload to be released to cytosol. The specific ionizable lipids in the approved mRNA-LNP vaccines have an accentuated molecular cone-shape through increased lipid tail branching for Lipid H13 (SM-102)14 from Moderna, and for ALC-031515 from Acuitas in the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine.”

“LNP electric charge is known to control in vivo distribution and expression of mRNA-LNPs for intravascular (IV) administration. Reducing the amount of cationic lipid in mRNA-LNPs created a negative LNP, due to an excess of anionic mRNA, that targeted the spleen after IV injection, versus positively charged LNPs targeting the lung 16. 

Similar charge-mediated targeting with IV delivery was also achieved using standard LNPs and mixing in a permanently cationic lipid or a permanently anionic lipid to endow the LNPs with a net positive, net negative, or an intermediate net charge that targeted the lungs, spleen, and liver, respectively7. Although charge-mediated targeting has not been examined for intramuscular (IM) administration, many studies that analyze expression after IM injection do find a systemic trafficking of mRNA-LNPs that strongly express in the liver very quickly, while simultaneously expressing in muscle and draining lymph nodes 17,18,19. These particular LNPs apparently enter the vasculature after IM injection and subsequently express in liver hepatocytes possibly due to passive ApoE-mediated targeting20. Systemic mRNA-LNP distribution and off target expression of immunogens could however generate systemic cytokines, activate complement, amplify the frequency or severity of adverse events that have been observed in recent clinical trials21,22, and/or impair immune response generation23. Only one prior study has been published for the optimization of the ionizable lipid in mRNA-LNPs for IM administration of vaccines, focusing mainly on increasing the degradability of the lipid to improve tolerability”

“lessons learned from nearly two decades of research on siRNA delivery
do not readily translate to mRNA delivery. “
“In this study, we investigate the effect of ionizable lipid tail chemistry on the efficacy of the
resulting lipid nanoparticle (LNP). While the role of amine chemistry on the mRNA delivery process
appears to be similar to siRNA delivery[11], there is currently a lack of understanding on why certain
tail chemistries confer efficacy while others do not. It is likely that mRNA delivery efficacy is determined, at least in part, by the molecular packing within the LNP. For example, lipid tail length and degree of unsaturation, which influence the bilayer packing properties of the LNP[12], have been shown to affect delivery potency[13]. In one study, DOPE was identified as the best helper phospholipid for mRNA-LNP formulations. The unsaturation in this lipid’s tail facilitated formation “
“Unlike siRNA delivery, which is determined by lipid nanoparticle pKa (e.g. when the nanoparticle becomes charged),
[15,16] our results suggest that mRNA delivery is influenced by how charged the lipid nanoparticles become.”
“These lipidoids, which have 10-carbon tails and identical molecular weights, vary only in that the 306O10 tail is straight and the 306Oi10 tail has a one-carbon branch. Remarkably, this small difference in structure conferred a 10-fold improvement in 306Oi10 efficacy. The enhanced potency of this branched-tail lipidoid was attributed to its strong surface ionization at the late endosomal pH of 5.0”
