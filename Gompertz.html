Gompertz is Only Growth Function Where Growth is Driven by a Straight Line.

Shows that J(t) dropping linearly from the very beginning is not expected from any other growth function than the Gompertz Function.

Gompertz fastest at start: just like a bullet but not a rocket. "

</p>
<p>CAPTION : "Gompertz:

X(t)=G(t)=Nexp[-exp[-(t-T)/U]] 
</p>
<p>
Parameter N is maximum platau value X(t) reaches when at large time, t.
</p>
<p>
Parameter T is the point of inflection, the time when the 2nd derivative of X(t) is 0 and its 1st derivative is a maximum at ( t=T , X(T)=N/e=0.37N
</p>

<p>
	NOTE ON ABOVE: 
	T is the highest point of the peak of the second derivative ;
	T is 37% of N, so at that point at 37% of the cases or deaths that will occur
</p>

<p>
Parameter U is a time constant which changes the shape of the curve 
The function X(t) or G(t)has the expected shape of saturating growth function
Normalizing X(t) by dividing by N and taking the (natural) logarithm gives 
ln[X(t)/N]=exp[-(t-T)/U] which increases rapidly and then curves smoothly to become hostizontal at saturation
</p>

<p>
The function :
  <b> Z(t)= ln[ln[N/X(t)]]= -(t-T)/U </b>
is defined by taking the logarithm again.
</p>

<p>
 If we know the actual value of N, then Z(t) is a linear function of t.  As N is not known until the epidemic is over, we try different N values to find the value that makes Z(t) the best straight line with the highest correlation coefficient (CC) with t. How we do this is shown by the curved dashed continuations of the red line. Once we have N for the best line, the slope 1/U and T is time, t, when Z(t) =0
</p>

<p>
The function :
 <b> J(t)= ln[ln[X(t)/(X(t-1)]]  </b> is also a linear function of time, t. It has the slope of 1/U and intercept of T/U+ln[1-exp(1/U)], from which  determine T and then N. The J(t) method compliments the Z(t) method and we use both. "

	NOTE: The main point about a bullet and a rocket is this: a bullet's energy source is applied when it released, from that point onward it has no source of energy; a rocket carries it's energy source with it, it's energy supply is always there until the source runs out.

</p>
<p>
	From Caption of pic: "
Two indentical Gompertz functions are added together, which is just what would happen for two totally independent outbreaks in the same country. The total number of Daily Cases is a simple sum of the Daily Cases from each outbreak.
</p>
<p>
The log of Exponential Growth Factor, J(t), is very different from the sum of J(t) of each curve. It can appear to show exponential growth, where J(t) is level with time, or even super-exponential growth, where J(t) increases with time. This is an artifact as the exponential growth factor for each outbreak is always slowing down as expected from a Gompertz function.
</p>
<p>
Both G(t) Functions have the same N and U  the value of T changes by delta T.
<br />
Both G(t) Functions have the same U, but N of 2nd is 3x greater; the value of T changes by delta T."
</p>

(my NOTE:
N is final plateau of cumulative cases or deaths, U is time constants ("the inverse slope of the lines or time-constant of decay")
T is time of peak; <i> U=duration of outbreak</i>)
